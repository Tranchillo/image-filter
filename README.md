# image-filter
A Python script to automate the filtering of images based on dimensions for dataset preparation. It scans a folder, checks image dimensions, and copies valid files (e.g., >= 512x512 pixels) into a separate subfolder. Ideal for preparing training data for machine learning models like LoRA.
